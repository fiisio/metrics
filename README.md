# metrics

forked from https://github.com/facebookgo/metrics and added some useful types

When I use facebook/metrics I find the type of it support just for int64 or int64[], but I should take all the events and error-logs in my developed modular. So I add the flow(ÊµÅ) type and mstring,then you can take some type-string data into it.
